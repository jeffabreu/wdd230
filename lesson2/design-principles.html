            <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>

            <p>Contrast is a very important tool here, we can notice that the "programat√≥rio"
                web page has a interesting way to catch the attention using background and text colors
                to produce a "come to see" experience to the viewers. The contrast makes the user
                feel confortable to know where to start and where to go.

            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>

            <img src="images/turma da monica pic.png" alt="turma da monica webpage">
            <p>Even not showing too much typography Hierarchy, this website has
                a particular way to grab the attention through the pictures, videos and
                all it's content by using the visual hierarchy principle. It's interesting
                how it is organized in a way that you know where you can find what you want,
                like it is structered to show a overview of the whole world of this cartoon
                content, than it shows the products and medias you can access.

            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <a href="https://m.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Youtube Webpage</a>
            <img src="images/youtube webpage.png" alt="youtube webpage">
            <p>As has been said "sometimes less is better", this is a one 
                of these cases. The white spaces and the simple design shows
                how this webpage has a important rule and because it has a variaty
                videos and not a single type of content I believe the more simple it
                is better will be the experience to the users.
